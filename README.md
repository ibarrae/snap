# SNAP FRAMEWORK 
The purpose of this repo is to get an insight of how the SNAP framework for haskell web development works.

To achieve this, a simple CRUD with simple validation for an user table is going to be developed.

Furthermore, the following links were used as a guide for installation and compiling the project:
